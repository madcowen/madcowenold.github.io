This site is still in progress, so I'm going to leave the default Hyde posts untouched for now. They might be 
helpful examples for when I want to do more complicated things with this website. Hopefully by late February 
this will be up and running!  

For now, a short introduction: I'm from Miami, Florida, and I love watching birds, learning about the natural 
world, and defying the patriarchy. I am passionate about diversifying academia, working toward social justice, 
and fighting climate change. This past fall, I received my Master's degree from UCLA, and now I'm working on 
developing a PhD project or two. I'm learing so much and have so much still to learn!
